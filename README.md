# OS-Detection-

Project Overview

The OS Detection project focuses on the classification of knee X-ray images to detect different stages of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a progressive bone disease characterized by reduced bone mass and structural deterioration, leading to increased fracture risk. Early and accurate detection is critical for effective intervention and treatment.

This project utilizes deep learning techniques to classify X-ray images into multiple classes based on the severity of osteoporosis. By leveraging advanced image processing and classification models, the project aims to assist medical professionals in automating the diagnostic process, potentially reducing human error and improving diagnostic efficiency.

Key highlights include:

A focus on improving classification accuracy across multiple severity levels.
Implementation of state-of-the-art neural network architectures.
Thorough evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, kappa, F1-score and Confusion Matrix.

Dataset Details
The dataset used in this project is the Multi-Class Knee Osteoporosis X-ray Dataset, sourced from Kaggle. This dataset contains high-quality X-ray images categorized into various stages of osteoporosis severity.

Dataset Overview:

Structure:

X-ray images organized into subdirectories based on class labels (e.g., Normal ~ 0 , Oestrogenesis ~ 1 and Osteoporosis ~ 2).
Each image is labeled with a corresponding severity level, ensuring easy mapping for training and validation.
